# Private Pokemon RPG Project
Basically, you should not view this, its not of your use, just leave, I repeat, JUST LEAVE.




This is basically a Pokemon RPG I've been developing, although it was started by someone else, I'm just doing some updates daily so that the owners could download it on their systems and modify it to their needs, that's it, I don't have much storage on my laptop so I'm going to put it on GitHub as a Cloud storage.
